# now_where_did_i_put_that

This project aims to write two functions - one which finds a character in a string and
another which finds a substring in a string. The output of these functions should be the
index where the character is found or where the substring begins.

It has the following acceptance criteria:

Write two functions which find a character / substring within a given string.

Use function overloading so that each of the functions has the same name. I donâ€™t want to
have to distinguish between findCharacter versus findSubstring.

Write a driver program that exercises your functions. Make sure that it tests a variety of
cases to ensure that your code is working as expected.
